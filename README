This install script intends to streamline the installation process of Arch
Linux; it will automate file editing and creation, and some system-wide
configurations. It intends to be POSIX-compliant and follow the Installation
Guide [1] whenever possible.

It can be run with the following command on an Arch Linux live media:

    sh <(curl -Ls git.io/vzWco)

Some caveats about the installation:

    * the script cannot be executed by piping `curl` to `sh`, since it
    needs a lot of user input

    * it was tested that the root partition should be created with at least
    1Â½ GB of space

    * the script is meant to be used with a fully formatted disk; unknown
    behavior is expected otherwise

    * to change the mount folder, use the following command instead (ignore
    the folder's trailing slash):

        sh <(curl -Ls git.io/vzWco | sed "s/mnt/$MOUNTPOINT/")

    * to change the EFI system partition size, use the following command
    for installation (use valid `parted` units [2]):

        sh <(curl -Ls git.io/vzWco | sed "s/50M/$BOOTSIZE/")

    * likewise, to change the `home` partition size, use:

        sh <(curl -Ls git.io/vzWco | sed "s/100%/$HOMESIZE/")

    * one can save the script locally and customize all of those
